# <%= get(:titleized_app_name) %>
This is a Rails application, initially generated using [Potassium](https://github.com/platanus/potassium) by Platanus.

## Local installation
Assuming you've just cloned the repo:
- Run 'bundle' to get your gems ready.
<% if(selected?(:database,:mysql) || selected?(:database,:postgresql))-%>
- Make sure you have <%=get(:database).to_s.titleize%> running on your computer, or configure an external <%=get(:database).to_s.titleize%> endpoint to work with.
<% end-%>
- Run 'rake db:setup' to create your tables.
- Run 'rails s' and watch puma start

## External services
TODO: add external services here

## Deployment
<% if selected?(:heroku) %>
This project is pre-configured to be (easily) deployed to Heroku servers, but needs you to have the Potassium binary installed. If you don't, then run:
```shell
$ gem install potassium
```
- Then, make sure you have the permissions required to create an app on the Platanus Heroku Account. Right now, this means having access to the Platanus Founders shared 1Password vault :)
- Then run
```shell
$ potassium heroku create
```
this will create the app on heroku, create a pipeline and link the app to the pipeline.

You'll still have to manually log in to the heroku dahsboard, go to the new pipeline and 'configure automatic deploys' using Github
